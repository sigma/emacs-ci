# internal web server (usually the html.WebStatus page) is visible. This
# typically uses the port number set in the Waterfall 'status' entry, but
# with an externally-visible host name which the buildbot cannot figure out
# without some help.

####### DB URL

# This specifies what database buildbot uses to store change and scheduler
# state.  You can leave this at its default for all but the largest
# installations.
